Chainsaw can use maximum of 7 oscillators in each [Voice](Voice.md). The oscillators are divided into 4 _Oscillator Groups_. Three of the Oscillator groups contain 2 oscillators, first group contains only one.

Oscillators have three parameters, it's only possible to set those by oscillator groups:

  1. **Type** - Oscillator waveform, can be one of:
    1. Sawtooth
    1. Sine
    1. Square
    1. Triangle
  1. **Volume** - The volume level of the oscillator
  1. **Octave** - Relative tuning in octaves.
