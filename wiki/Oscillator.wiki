# Explanation of Chainsaw oscillators

Chainsaw can use maximum of 7 oscillators in each [Voice]. The oscillators are divided into 4 _Oscillator Groups_. Three of the Oscillator groups contain 2 oscillators, first group contains only one.

Oscillators have three parameters, it's only possible to set those by oscillator groups:

  # *Type* - Oscillator waveform, can be one of:
    # Sawtooth
    # Sine
    # Square
    # Triangle
  # *Volume* - The volume level of the oscillator
  # *Octave* - Relative tuning in octaves.
