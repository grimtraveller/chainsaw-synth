= Introduction =

Stereo Spread is a parameter which makes the sound deeper or more condensed mono. It spreads the oscillators around in the stereo space. When at minimum, all oscillators are panned in the middle. When at maximum, the oscillators in the last group are hard panned to left and right, while the others cover the rest of the stereo space, with the group one still panned in the middle.
