Chainsaw is a basic polyphonic subtractive synthesizer, loosely based on the ideas from the supersaw oscillator found on some Roland synthesizers. It offers a very simple interface, and should be relatively light on the CPU.

To find out more, read the [Manual](Manual.md). Or download the plugin from under the the [downloads tab](http://code.google.com/p/chainsaw-synth/downloads/list).

To install the plugin, copy the unpacked .so file into ~/.vst folder. (Create it if it doesn't exist).
